# Steps perform in this project

**1. Understanding the Problem**
   
   I aimed to analyze how students perform in their academics based on factors like gender, parents' education, sports participation, and ethnicity. This helps identify patterns and key influences on student success
   
**2. Collecting and Loading Data**
   
   I used a dataset of student scores and information on their background. This data was loaded into the analysis environment (Python) using libraries like Pandas for easier manipulation.
   
**3. Data Cleanup**

   Some unnecessary columns or irrelevant data (like "Unnamed" columns) were removed to make the dataset more usable.
   
**4. Visualizing the Data (Graphs)**

   I created various graphs to understand the data better:
   
      •	Bar Plot for Gender Distribution: Shows how many students are male or female.
      
      •	Heatmaps: Visualized how parents' education and marital status relate to student scores.
      
      •	Boxplots for Scores: Showed the distribution of scores in Math, Reading, and Writing.

      •	Pie Chart for Ethnic Group Distribution: Showed the proportion of students from different ethnic backgrounds.
   
**5. Analyzing the Graphs**

   Each graph was examined to identify patterns or insights. For example:
   
      •	Higher parent education often leads to better student performance.
      
      •	Students who participate in sports tend to have better academic results.
      
      •	The score ranges across subjects (Math, Reading, Writing) were compared.
   
**6. Drawing Conclusions**

   Based on the graphs, I summarized that parental involvement (education and marital status) and extracurricular activities (like sports) play important roles in academic success.
